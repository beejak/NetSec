# Vulnerability Intelligence

This document is the **single place** to find and document how the NetSec Toolkit stays aligned with the latest reported bugs and vulnerabilities (CVE, CWE, NIST NVD, etc.). It defines where search queries live, where fetched results are stored or documented, and how we log scanner updates driven by new bugs.

---

## Purpose

- **Keep scanners up to date** with developments for reported bugs (CVE, CWE, NIST, OSV, CISA KEV, GitHub Advisory).
- **Centralize** search query definitions, result storage/documentation, and a log of when scanners were updated because of a specific CVE or weakness.

## Where things live

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| **Search queries** (what to query from each source) | [vulnerability-intel/queries.md](vulnerability-intel/queries.md) |
| **Fetched results** (data or links + summaries) | [vulnerability-intel/results/](vulnerability-intel/results/) |
| **Scanner update log** (CVE/CWE → scanner changes) | [vulnerability-intel/scanner-updates.md](vulnerability-intel/scanner-updates.md) |
| **Overview and source links** | [vulnerability-intel/README.md](vulnerability-intel/README.md) |

## Vetted sources

All referenced sources are **official or widely used government/industry sources**:

| Source | Owner | Link |
|--------|--------|------|
| **NIST NVD** | U.S. NIST | [nvd.nist.gov](https://nvd.nist.gov/) – [API start](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/start-here) |
| **CVE** | MITRE | [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/) – [Data downloads](https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/index.html) |
| **CWE** | MITRE | [cwe.mitre.org](https://cwe.mitre.org/) – [Downloads](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/downloads.html) |
| **OSV** | Google (OpenSSF) | [osv.dev](https://osv.dev) – [API](https://google.github.io/osv.dev/api/) |
| **CISA KEV** | U.S. CISA | [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) |
| **GitHub Advisory** | GitHub | [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories) – [REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/security-advisories/global-advisories) |

Query templates and parameters for each source are in [vulnerability-intel/queries.md](vulnerability-intel/queries.md).

## Process (placeholder)

1. **Define or update search queries** in [vulnerability-intel/queries.md](vulnerability-intel/queries.md) (e.g. by product, ecosystem, date range, severity).
2. **Fetch or document results** in [vulnerability-intel/results/](vulnerability-intel/results/) (store exports or link to sources with a short summary).
3. **When a scanner is updated** because of a bug, add a row in [vulnerability-intel/scanner-updates.md](vulnerability-intel/scanner-updates.md) (date, CVE/CWE/id, source, scanner(s) updated, note).

No automated fetchers or CVE DB are implemented yet; this structure is the placeholder for when you add them (e.g. for [BasicVulnerabilityScanner](netsec-container/src/netsec_container/core/vulnerability_basic.py) or new checks).
