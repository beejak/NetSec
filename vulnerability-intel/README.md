# Vulnerability Intelligence

This folder is the **placeholder** for vulnerability intelligence: search queries, fetched results, and a log of scanner updates driven by CVE/CWE/NIST and other vetted sources.

---

## Purpose

- **Search queries:** Define what to query from CVE (NVD), CWE, NIST NVD, OSV, CISA KEV, and GitHub Advisory so we can pull the latest bugs in the wild. See [queries.md](queries.md).
- **Results:** Store or document fetched vulnerability data (exports or links + summaries). See [results/](results/).
- **Scanner updates:** Log when we update NetSec scanners (Core, Cloud, Container) because of a specific CVE/CWE. See [scanner-updates.md](scanner-updates.md).

---

## Vetted sources (official / industry-standard)

All sources referenced in [queries.md](queries.md) are legitimate and vetted:

| Source | Owner | What it provides |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **NIST NVD** | U.S. NIST | CVE details, CVSS, CPE; official U.S. government vulnerability database. |
| **CVE** | MITRE | CVE list and records; industry-standard identifier for vulnerabilities. |
| **CWE** | MITRE | Common Weakness Enumeration; taxonomy of software weaknesses. |
| **OSV** | Google (OpenSSF) | Open-source vulnerabilities by ecosystem/version; used by many tools. |
| **CISA KEV** | U.S. CISA | Known Exploited Vulnerabilities; prioritizes actively exploited CVEs. |
| **GitHub Advisory** | GitHub | GHSA + CVE for many ecosystems; GitHub-reviewed advisories. |

---

## How often to refresh (placeholder)

- **Manual:** Run queries or fetches periodically (e.g. weekly) and store results or links in [results/](results/).
- **Automated:** When you add API clients or scripts, run them on a schedule (e.g. CI or cron) and write outputs into [results/](results/). Document the schedule here when implemented.

## Who maintains this

Maintainers and anyone adding CVE/CWE/NIST-driven checks. When you add a new query template or source, update [queries.md](queries.md) and this README if needed.
