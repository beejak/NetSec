# Scanner update log

Record when NetSec scanners (Core, Cloud, Container) are updated because of a specific CVE, CWE, or other vulnerability. This keeps the toolkit aligned with latest developments for reported bugs.

## How to use

When you change a scanner (e.g. add a CVE check, a new pattern, or a remediation) because of a vulnerability from one of the vetted sources:

1. Add a row with the date, CVE/CWE/id, source (NVD, OSV, CISA KEV, etc.), which scanner(s), and a short note.
2. Optionally link to the source (e.g. NVD URL) or to the commit/PR that made the change.

This log is the audit trail for "we updated our scanners with the latest developments for reported bugs."
