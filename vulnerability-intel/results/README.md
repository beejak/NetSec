# Fetched results (placeholder)

This folder is the **placeholder** for storing or documenting fetched vulnerability data from vetted sources (NVD, CVE, CWE, OSV, CISA KEV, GitHub Advisory).

---

## What goes here

- **Exports:** JSON, CSV, or other files produced by NVD/OSV/KEV fetchers or manual downloads. Prefer descriptive names (e.g. `nvd-modified-2025-02-01.json`, `kev-catalog-2025-02.csv`).
- **Summaries:** Markdown files that link to source pages and summarize findings (e.g. "New critical CVEs this week" with links and CVE IDs). Use this if you prefer not to commit large JSON/CSV files.
- **Links-only:** If results are stored elsewhere (external store, git-lfs), put a short README or index here that points to that location and how to refresh it.

---

## Format and size

- **Format:** Any; document the format in the filename or a small `index.md` in this folder.
- **Large files:** If exports are large, consider adding `*.json` or `*.csv` to `.gitignore` in this folder and document that results are fetched on demand or stored externally. Optionally use git-lfs for binary/large exports.

---

## Refreshing

- **Manual:** Re-run your queries or download from the vetted sources (see [../queries.md](../queries.md)) and overwrite or add new files here.
- **Automated:** When you add scripts or CI jobs, have them write outputs here and document the schedule in [../README.md](../README.md).
