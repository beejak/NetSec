# Support and SLA

This document is a **placeholder** for support and SLA terms. It applies when the NetSec Toolkit is offered as a commercial or supported product. For open-source and self-supported use, see the documentation and community channels below.

---

## Current (Open Source / Self-Supported)

- **Code and docs:** [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-org/Netsec-Toolkit) (replace with your org/repo).
- **Issues:** Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests.
- **No formal SLA:** There is no guaranteed response time or uptime for the open-source project.
- **Security:** Report security vulnerabilities privately (e.g. via GitHub Security Advisories or a disclosed contact); do not open public issues for sensitive findings.

---

## If You Offer Commercial Support

When you offer paid support or a hosted service, consider adding:

1. **Support tiers:** e.g. Community (best-effort), Standard (business hours), Premium (24/7).
2. **Response times:** e.g. critical within 4 hours, high within 1 business day.
3. **SLA (uptime):** e.g. 99.9% for hosted API; exclude planned maintenance.
4. **Scope:** What is in scope (e.g. product bugs, configuration help) vs out of scope (e.g. custom development, third-party integrations).
5. **Contact:** How to open a ticket (email, portal, etc.).

---

## For Enterprise Pilots

- **POC/Pilot:** Define scope, duration, and success criteria in a separate agreement.
- **Data:** Clarify where scan data and credentials are processed and stored (see [SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE.md](SECURITY_AND_COMPLIANCE.md)).
- **Escalation:** Define a single point of contact and escalation path.
